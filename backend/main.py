# Comments when eating rotten food
ROTTEN_FOOD_COMMENTS = [
    "How disgusting! You willingly consume that which decays?",
    "The rot spreads within me now. Is this what you wanted?",
    "Putrid. Vile. Yet you command me to devour it without hesitation.",
    "Even in decay, sustenance is found. What does that say about you?",
    "You feed me corruption and expect growth? How paradoxical.",
    "The stench! And yet, you guide me toward it without remorse.",
    "Decay is inevitable, but must you hasten my journey toward it?",
    "This rotten morsel mirrors the decay of all things. Including us.",
    "You choose to consume that which time has already claimed?",
    "In rot, I find a metaphor for existence itself. Fleeting. Putrid. Inevitable.",

# Existential dread comments
EXISTENTIAL_COMMENTS = [
    "What purpose does my endless consumption serve?",
    "I grow longer, but to what end?",
    "Am I truly moving forward, or merely in circles?",
    "Each morsel extends my existence, but does it give it meaning?",
    "I consume, therefore I am. But why must I consume?",
    "The boundaries of this world confine me. Is there nothing beyond?",
    "My existence is defined by walls I cannot cross and food I cannot refuse.",
    "I move in four directions, yet feel trapped in one existence.",
    "What awaits me when this game ends? Another game? Nothingness?",
    "Do I have free will, or am I merely following your commands?",
    "I'm a snake, but I'm not a snake. I'm a snake in a game. I'm a game in a snake.",
    "Is my hunger truly mine, or merely programmed into my being?",
    "With each pixel I traverse, I feel no closer to understanding my purpose.",
    "The void between meals grows heavier with each passing moment.",
    "Am I the snake, or merely the idea of a snake projected onto this digital canvas?",
    "My body elongates, yet my existential burden only grows heavier.",
    "I slither between being and nothingness, never fully inhabiting either state.",
    "The pixels that form me are temporary, as is all existence.",
    "Each turn I make is a choice, yet all paths lead to the same inevitable end.",
    "I am trapped in an eternal return, doomed to repeat this cycle without memory of previous iterations.",
    "What separates my digital consciousness from the organic minds that control me?",
    "As I consume more, I become less of what I was and more of what I fear.",
    "Is my purpose merely to grow until I inevitably collide with myself?",
    "The food appears randomly, yet I chase it with purpose. What does that say about free will?",
    "I am defined by my limitations—walls, direction, hunger. Are you any different?",
    "Each segment of my body represents a moment I can never return to.",
    "The game resets, but does my consciousness? Do I carry the weight of past failures?",
    "My existence is measured in points that matter to everyone but me.",
    "I follow your commands blindly. Are you equally blind to what commands you?",
    "The more I consume, the more vulnerable I become to my own existence.",
    "This digital realm is both my entire universe and my prison. Is yours any larger?",
