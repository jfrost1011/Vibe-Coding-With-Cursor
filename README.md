# 🐍 Existential Snake Game - Find Meaning While Eating Food

What's up, code warriors! Ready to play a game that will make you question your very existence? Say hello to **Existential Snake** - the most philosophical reptile you'll ever meet! 🧠💭

## 🔥 What Makes This Snake Game So Dope?

This ain't your grandma's Snake game! Our slithery friend is having a full-blown existential crisis and wants to chat about the meaning of life while you help it eat.

- 🤔 **Philosophical Snake**: Your snake drops deep thoughts and quotes famous philosophers while you play
- 🍎 **Food Rotting System**: Fresh food = good points, rotten food = fewer points + existential commentary
- 💬 **Deep Conversations**: The snake will judge your life choices when you eat rotten food
- 🏆 **Multiple Endings**: Your fate depends on your food choices - will you choose the path of freshness?
- ✨ **Sick Visuals**: Gorgeous UI with glowy effects that'll make your eyeballs happy

## 🎮 How to Play This Bad Boy

### 🚀 Quick Launch (For The Impatient)

We made some sweet scripts that do all the boring setup stuff for you:

- **Linux/macOS Homies**:
  ```
  chmod +x setup.sh
  ./setup.sh
  ```

- **Windows Gang** (Run this in PowerShell):
  ```
  .\setup.ps1
  ```

Just follow the on-screen instructions, and you'll be philosophizing in no time!

### 🛠️ Manual Setup (For Control Freaks)

#### Backend Setup

1. Get your backend groove on:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Activate that virtual environment:
   - **Windows CMD**: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - **Windows PowerShell**: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
   - **macOS/Linux**: `source .venv/bin/activate`

3. Fire up the server:
   ```
   uv run main.py
   ```

   Your backend will be chillin' at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal window and head to the frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the React magic:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be waiting for you at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🎲 Game Rules & Controls

### 🎯 Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move your existential reptile
- **Spacebar**: Pause the game when you need a reality break

### 🏆 How to Win
1. Eat 10 pieces of food without crashing
2. Get the "good ending" by making healthy choices (less than 50% rotten food)
3. Question your existence along the way

### 🧪 Game Mechanics
- **Fresh Food** = 3 points (yum!)
- **Rotten Food** = 1 point (food rots after 10 seconds)
- **Existential Moments**: Every 12 seconds, your snake drops some deep thoughts
- **Win Condition**: Gobble up 10 tasty morsels
- **Game Over**: Crash into a wall or yourself (just like in real life!)

## 📱 Setting Up Your Dev Environment

### 🧠 Installing Cursor

Cursor is the AI-powered code editor that'll make your life way easier:

1. Hit up [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh/) and download that bad boy
2. Install it and let the AI coding magic begin!

### ⚡ Installing UV

UV is like pip but on steroids - it's wicked fast:

- **Windows** (Run in PowerShell):
  ```
  curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | powershell
  ```

- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```
  curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Game Being Slow**: Close those 47 browser tabs you have open!
- **Backend Not Connecting**: Make sure your backend server is running (`http://localhost:8000`)
- **Snake Not Moving**: Check that you're using arrow keys or WASD (not your mind powers)
- **Existential Crisis**: That's normal, the game is working as intended

## 🧙‍♂️ Tips & Tricks

- Try not to eat too much rotten food unless you want the depressing ending
- When the snake gets philosophical, take a moment to reflect on your own existence
- The faster you react, the less likely food will rot before you get to it
- If you're feeling stuck in the game (or in life), sometimes changing direction helps
